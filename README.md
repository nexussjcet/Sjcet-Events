# SJCET Events Dashboard

**SJCET Event Dashboard** is a web application that provides a platform for managing and viewing events happening at SJCET. It offers a user-friendly interface for organizers to add, manage, and display events, enhancing the overall experience for both organizers and participants.

## Features
1. **Event Management**: Organizers can easily add new events through a user-friendly form. These events are then dynamically displayed on the events page, providing a centralized location for all college activities.

2. **Detailed Event View**: Each event is represented as a card on the events page. Clicking on an event card opens up a detailed view, providing more information about the event such as date, time, location, and description.

3. **User Registration and Event Redirection**: Users can register for events by providing their details through a registration form. After registration, they are redirected to the event website where they can access additional event information and resources.

## How it Works
- Organizers can add an event by filling out a form with the event's details. Once submitted, the event is added to the database and displayed on the events page. Each event is represented as a card, which can be clicked to view more details.
